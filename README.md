# Freescale-Cup
I participated in the 7th Freescale Cup: Intelligent Car Racing in 2012 and wrote the code for the competition when I was junior. The competition was held in Xiamen, China and included over 300 teams. The performance of our intelligent car can be seen in my youtube channels [Preliminary competition vedio](https://youtu.be/EjKdjxUqkzo) and [Final competition vedio](https://youtu.be/WgwOIf9HDZs)

# Introduction of code
In this competition, a CMOS camera was used to capture track, and a 16-bits microcontroller was employed to process input data (e.g. track extraction and track classification) and outputted controlling signals. The code is written with C, and run in the microcontroller [**MC9S12XS128**](https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/product-brief/MC9S12XS256PB.pdf)
