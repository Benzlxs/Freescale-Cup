# Freescale-Cup
I participated in the 7th Freescale Cup: Intelligent Car Racing in 2012 and wrote the code for the competition when I was junior. The Freescale cup was held in Xiamen, China and included over 300 teams.  [Preliminary competition vedio](https://youtu.be/EjKdjxUqkzo) and [Final competition vedio](https://youtu.be/WgwOIf9HDZs)
